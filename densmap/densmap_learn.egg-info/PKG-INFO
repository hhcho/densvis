Description: # densMAP
        
        This software package contains an implementation of density-preserving data visualization tool **densMAP**, which augments the [UMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) algorithm.
        Some of the following instructions are adapted from the UMAP repository.
        
        ## Installation
        densMAP shares the same dependencies as UMAP, including:
        
        * numpy
        * scipy
        * scikit-learn
        * numba==0.48.0
        
        Our code currently does not support the latest version of numba (0.49.0).
        
        ### Install Options
        
        PyPI installation of densMAP, assuming all dependencies are installed, can be performed as:
        
        ```bash
        
            pip install densmap-learn
        ```
        
        For a manual install, first download this package:
        
        ```bash
            wget https://github.com/hhcho/densvis/archive/master.zip
            unzip master.zip
            rm master.zip
            cd densvis-master/densmap/
        ```
        
        Install the requirements:
        
        ```bash
            sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```bash
            conda install scikit-learn numba
        ```
        
        Finally, install the package:
        
        ```bash
            python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### The densMAP class
        Like UMAP, the densMAP package inherits from sklearn classes, and thus drops in neatly
        next to other sklearn transformers with an identical calling API.
        
        ```python
        
            import densmap
            from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
            from sklearn.utils import resample
            
            digits = fetch_openml(name='mnist_784')
        
            subsample, subsample_labels = resample(digits.data, digits.target, n_samples=7000,
            	       			  	   stratify=digits.target, random_state=1)
        
            embedding, ro, re = densmap.densMAP().fit_transform(subsample)
        ```
        
        #### Input arguments
        
        There are a number of parameters that can be set for the densMAP class; the
        major ones inherited from UMAP are:
        
         -  ``n_neighbors``: This determines the number of neighboring points used in
            local approximations of manifold structure. Larger values will result in
            more global structure being preserved at the loss of detailed local
            structure. In general this parameter should often be in the range 5 to
            50; we set a default of 30.
        
         -  ``min_dist``: This controls how tightly the embedding is allowed compress
            points together. Larger values ensure embedded points are more evenly
            distributed, while smaller values allow the algorithm to optimise more
            accurately with regard to local structure. Sensible values are in the
            range 0.001 to 0.5, with 0.1 being a reasonable default.
        
         -  ``metric``: This determines the choice of metric used to measure distance
            in the input space. A wide variety of metrics are already coded, and a user
            defined function can be passed as long as it has been JITd by numba.
        
        The additional parameters specific to densMAP are:
        
        - ``dens_frac``: This determines the fraction of iterations that will include
          the density-preservation term of the gradient. As default, we set this to
          0.3.
        
        - ``dens_lambda``: This determines the weight of the density-preservation
          objective. See the original paper for the effect this parameter has when changed.
          By default, we set it to 2.0.
        
        - ``final_dens``: When this flag is True, the code returns, in addition to the embedding,
          the local radii for the original dataset and for the embedding. If False, only the embedding
          is returned. Default True
        
        Other parameters that can be set include:
        
        - ``ndim``: Dimensions of the embedding; default 2
        
        - ``n_epochs``: Number of epochs to run the algorithm; default 750
        
        - ``var_shift``: Regularization term added to the variance of embedding local radius for stability; default 0.1
        
        #### Output arguments
        If `final_dens` is True, returns `(embedding, ro, re)`, where: 
        - `embedding`: a (number of data points)-by-`ndims` numpy array containing the embedding coordinates
        
        - `ro`: a numpy array of length (number of data points) that contains the log local radius of
        the input data
        
        - `re`: a numpy array of length (number of data points) that contains the log local radius
        of the embedded data
        
        If `final_dens` is False, returns just `embedding`. 
        
        An example of making use of these options:
        
        ```python
            import densmap
            from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
            from sklearn.utils import resample
            
            digits = fetch_openml(name='mnist_784')
        
            subsample, subsample_labels = resample(digits.data, digits.target, n_samples=7000,
            	       			  	   stratify=digits.target)
        
            embedding, ro, re = densmap.densMAP(n_neighbors=5, dens_frac=0.2,
                                                dens_lambda=3.).fit_transform(subsample)
        
        ```
        
        ### From the command line
        
        We also provide the file `densmap.py` which allows you to run densMAP from the terminal,
        specifying the major options from above. Simply run:
        
        ```bash
            python densmap.py -i [--input INPUT] -o [--outname OUTNAME] -f [--dens_frac DENS_FRAC]
            -l [--dens_lambda DENS_LAMBDA] -s [--var_shift VAR_SHIFT] -d [--ndim NDIM]
            -n [--n-epochs N-EPOCHS] -k [--n-nei N-NEIGHBORS]
            
        ```
        where within the square braces are the long-form flag and the capitalized text corresponds to
        the parameters above. For example:
        ```
            python densmap.py -i data.txt -o out -f .3 -k 25
        ```
        and
        ```
            python densmap.py --input data.txt --outname out --dens_frac .3 --n-nei 25
        ```
        both run densMAP on input file `data.txt` to produce output files `out_emb.txt`
        and `out_dens.txt`, using `dens_frac = 0.3` and `n_neighbors=25`. 
        
        The output files include:
        
        * `out_emb.txt` a TSV file containing the embedding coordinatesof the data, and
        * `out_dens.txt` a (number of data points)-by-2 TSV file containing in the first column the log local radii in the original data and in the second column the log local radii in the embedding.
        
        ## Example data and script
        We have included the file `trial_densmap.py` which allows you to run an example straight out of
        the box.
        
        Run: 
        ```bash
            python trial_densmap.py
        ```
        
        The code will load a dataset that contains a mixture of six Gaussian point clouds
        with increasing variance and
        will run both densMAP and UMAP on the dataset with default parameters and plot the embeddings
        (if you have matplotlib installed),
        and alignment of the local radius in each case. It will also save the embeddings
        ("{umap,densmap}_trial_emb.txt"),
        local radii ("{umap,densmap}_trial_dens.txt"), and the plot ("densmap_trial_fig.png").
        
        The plot will look like:
